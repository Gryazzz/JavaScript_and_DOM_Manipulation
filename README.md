The purpose is to create a dynamically rendered table with multiple searches and pagination using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* Write code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (e.g. 50 results per page).
* These changes should happen in the DOM using JavaScript, therefore the user should never be directed to another web page as they paginate through the results.
